For our Cmpe230 (Systems Programming) course project 1.

## Purpose
To create a python-like interpreter in C language. The interpreter should abide by operator precedence and associavity. Also the interpreter should have a few keywords for functions `not, lr(left rotate), rr(right rotate), ls(left shift), rs(right shift), or` .

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc *.c -o advCalc.exe`. Then run the program by typing `./advCalc.exe`. The program should run and you can type your expressions or assignments in it. You can:
- Set variables some value. ex: `myVar = 3 + 2`
- Print the value of expressions. ex: `3 + ls(3,2)`

When you want to exit the program you can `Ctrl + C` on windows and mac, and `Ctrl + D` on linux.
